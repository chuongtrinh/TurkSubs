A day on the Bus

6
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Lonely is a Bus

(Traffic noise)

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey John, I'm sorry, sorry about the other night. I just got this

10
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This thing with Kate and just didn't want to be around a group of strangers
hey c'mon forget about it, hey forget about it, forget about it, forget about it
So how is this thing

11
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
-How's the show?
-Well, I thought I gave a command performance. 
-Good
-Opinions varied. So who's to say, I don't know, who's to say what really

12
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What really happened? Um I'm trying to stay positive with it.

Are these supposed to be up here?

Uh, those are not supposed to be up here actually. People just leave

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
leave things here, a bunch of savages. So what happened between you and Kate? It was just another argument about

14
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't even know. Its just, we just started yelling at each other.

Just spontaneous yelling. Just one minute you're fine, and the next minute ah! Ah! AH! AH! 

Just zero to sixty.

15
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
sixty.

That sounds terrible. Is that what, is, that what marriage is like?

That's what my marriage is like.

Jesus! It sounds like a nightmare.

We haven't even talked to each other since then. 



16
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What does that mean?

No words have gone from my mouth to her ears.

And vice versa.

Thank you.

That's crazy. You know you guys are adults

17
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's in a committed relationship right? What happens if you have to pass each other in the hallway? Just nothing, just dead eyes the whole time. Just ships in the night? You guys just

18
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I just schwooh. just...

Oh yeah we don't make eye contact.

OOoh

Takes care of that.

Ooh well that's smart

I mean in my experience if you ignore a problem long enough

19
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
just long enough. It actually just goes away.

(laughs) sure, just look at Hitler.

Not sure I'm following...

Well, he 

20
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He had a problem. With a certain group of people.

Oooh

 Not gonna say who. 

Sure. 

The jews!

21
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And, uh, instead of ignoring his problems, like we all should! He started a war, and uh, then we got in on it. And bleh bleh bleh Fat man, little boy! 

22
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Boy, god. It did not end well for him. Suffice to say, dude just ignore your problems. And I think that's a lesson for all of us.

Wait, so you're saying I shouldn't engage in mass ethnic cleansing?

23
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
cleansing in the hopes of making my marriage better?

Dude! I'm just saying you gotta explore all the diplomatic options first! If that fails I don't know what to tell you.

That's probably good advice.

24
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000

26
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 

27
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hey! You were on the 9:05 yesterday morning right?

Yeah

You know, this was the third time that that bus was gone

28
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
has gotten me to work late in the last week. I mean I know that it is not an exact science, but, I just feel like if you're gonna say the bus is going to be there at 9:30, it should be there 

29
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
there around 9:30 you know. Not 9:50.

Yeah, I think that bus driver's still new.

Unfortunately, still new bus driver isn't really a 

30
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
really a very good excuse for my boss. Well, he's the kind of person that thinks if you're not five minutes early then you're late.

Sorry.

It's OK.

31
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I mean, he can't really afford to fire me. I mean, where else is he going to find a temporary office assistant who's willing to work for minimum wage and no benefits.

32
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What about your boss? Does he, uh, does he get mad if you get to work late?

I don't really  have a boss. I mean, technically I do. But I can't see him getting too worked up about

33
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
about time cards. 

Where do you work?

Brave new books. Its an alternative book store. You know, everything you know about 9/11 being an inside 

34
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,000
-Job, the reptilian elite, we've got it all.
-Sound's like it. So, why do you take the bus? I mean, there are only like

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Not Everyone fits in a Box
